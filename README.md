This package enables the powerful Laravel Debugbar for safe and effective use in production environments. It allows developers to gain valuable insights into application performance, database queries, and request lifecycle without compromising security or negatively impacting the user experience. Utilize this tool for fast debugging and performance analysis directly on your live application.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require malzariey/production-debugbar
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="production-debugbar-config"
```

This is the contents of the published config file with the default password used to enable the debugbar:

```php
return [
    "password" => env("PRODUCTION_DEBUGBAR_PASSWORD", "MyPassword"),
];


```
**Note**: 

Make sure to add PRODUCTION_DEBUGBAR_PASSWORD to your .env file if you want to change the password configuration.

## Usage

This package provides a middleware that automatically checks if the Laravel Debugbar should be enabled based on request cookie, you can enable the Debugbar on any route by adding a query parameter with a specific password that matches the one configured in your production-debugbar-config file. For example:

https://your-production-app.com/any-route?your_configured_password

Replace your_configured_password with the actual password set in your configuration.
